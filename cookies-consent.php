            Cookies are used to keep track of whether you are logged in. A cookie containing
            a session ID is stored on your computer and sent to the server with each request
            to identify your account. This data persists for a single session (the length of
            which depends on your browser).

            HTML5 session storage is used to save your work when you are creating a thread or
            post in the website forum, so it is not lost if you reload the page. This data
            persists for a single browser session, and is never sent to the server.

            HTML5 local storage is used to keep track of whether you have agreed to this policy.
            This data persists until you delete it, by clearing cookies and site data 
            in your browser, for example, and is never sent to the server.
